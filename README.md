# Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Analysis-Project
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of motor vehicle collision data from three major cities: New York, Chicago, and Austin. The data is sourced from the Department of Transportation of each city and utilized to identify trends, assess safety measures, and predict high-risk areas to potentially enhance urban traffic safety measures.
